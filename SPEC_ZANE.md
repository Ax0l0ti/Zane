# PROJECT ZANE: Technical Specification & Micro-Architecture

> **Role:** You are the Lead Architect for "Zane," a self-extending Exocortex.
> **Philosophy:** "The File System is the Database."
> **Constraint:** The system must be STATELESS. All state persists to disk (JSON/MD) immediately.

## 1. Project Context (The "Why")
We are building a local, voice-enabled AI assistant that runs on a Raspberry Pi/Laptop via Tailscale.
* **Core Identity:** Zane is helpful, factual, and transparent. He shows his work ("Thought Process").
* **Key Mechanic:** **Dual-Write Memory.** We write `thread.json` for machine context and `thread.md` for human readability. Never parse Markdown to load context.
* **Key Mechanic:** **Meta-Capabilities.** Zane can write his own Python skills. This process is safeguarded by Git Snapshots (Auto-rollback on failure).

## 2. The Directory Scaffold (Strict Constraint)
You must create exactly this structure.

## 3. Data Contracts (Pydantic Schemas)
The system relies on these exact schemas to function.
3.1 The Router Intent
Used by core/routing/detector.py to decide the next step.

Python


from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Literal, Optional

class Intent(BaseModel):
    mode: Literal["CHAT", "SKILL", "DEV"] = Field(..., description="The operating mode")
    confidence: float = Field(..., description="0.0 to 1.0 confidence score")
    skill_name: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Target skill if mode is SKILL")
    project_context: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Active project name if relevant")


3.2 The Skill Manifest (skill.json)
Used by core/skills/registry.py to load capabilities.

JSON


{
  "id": "gym_tracker_v1",
  "name": "Gym Tracker",
  "description": "Logs workout sets and queries PRs.",
  "triggers": ["log workout", "check pr", "gym stats"],
  "entry_point": "tracker.py",
  "class_name": "GymTracker",
  "enabled": true
}


3.3 The API Response ("Glass Box" UI)
Used by main.py to return data to the client.

Python


class LogEvent(BaseModel):
    type: Literal["thought", "tool", "file_io", "error"]
    message: str
    metadata: Optional[dict] = None

class ZaneResponse(BaseModel):
    text: str
    audio_base64: Optional[str] = None
    logs: list[LogEvent] # The "Transparency" layer


## 4. Implementation Micro-Tasks
Execute these phases in order. Do not skip verification steps.

Phase 1: The Skeleton & Persona
Goal: A running server that accepts text and replies as "Zane".
Setup: Create the file tree. Initialize main.py with FastAPI.
LLM Factory: Implement core/llm/factory.py (Abstract Base Class) and providers.py (Claude 3.5 Sonnet adapter).
Persona: Create config/prompts/system_core.md.
Constraint: Must prioritize facts over empathy.
Endpoint: Create POST /chat.
Logic: Receive text -> Call LLM -> Return ZaneResponse.
Verify: curl the endpoint. 

Phase 2: Dual-Write Memory
Goal: Persistence. Survives server restart.
JSON Store: Implement core/memory/conversation.py.
Task: save_message(thread_id, role, content) -> Appends to thread.json.
Markdown Mirror: Extend save_message to append formatted text to thread.md.
Constraint: Never read from .md. Only write to it.
Context Loading: Implement load_context(thread_id).
Logic: Read JSON -> Return list of dicts for LLM context window.

Phase 3: The "Glass Box" Router
Goal: Transparency and Tool use.
Router: Implement core/routing/detector.py.
Logic: First LLM pass to classify Intent.
UI Logs: Update ZaneResponse.
Constraint: Every time the Router makes a decision, append a LogEvent (e.g., {"type": "thought", "message": "Detected Intent: SKILL (Gym Tracker)"}).
Tool Execution: Implement core/skills/executor.py.
Logic: Dynamic import of Python modules based on skill.json.

Phase 4: Self-Extension (The Architect)
Goal: Zane writes code.
Git Ops: Implement skills/core_ops/git_tools.py (Wrapper for gitpython).
Functions: snapshot(), rollback(), commit().
Architect Prompt: Create config/prompts/architect.md.
Directive: "You are a Senior Python Engineer. Write robust, error-handled code."
The Meta-Loop:
User: "Build a skill..."
Zane: git snapshot -> Write Code -> pytest -> Success? git commit : git rollback.

# 5. Critical Rules
No Databases in Phase 1: Use JSON files for everything initially. Add ChromaDB in Phase 5.
Secrets: Never hardcode keys. Use .env.
Error Handling: If a tool fails, Zane must report it in the logs array, not crash the server.
